[TASK] Added searchfields to TCA
Enable the searching over fields of new created domain objects in backend list view
[BUGFIX] Replaced wrong inline configuration
It should be collapseAll instead of collapse in appearance TCA
Resolves: #38371
[BUGFIX] Reapplied xlf replacements
[BUGFIX] static typoscript had wrong conditions
The condition testing only the classHirarchy was not sufficient in certain cases,
since the configuration has to be created also, if a model was only mapped to another table
[TASK] Prepare default reST Documentation [TASK] Reflect overwrite settings in mkdir_deep
[BUGFIX] Parameter for action methods had wrong type hint
Fixed some unit tests (Typoscript setup for features and lowercase classnames in parameter type hints)
[TASK] Enable sorting of models
Resolves: ##29110
[TASK] Replaced locallang.xml with xlf in templates
Resolves: #37945
[{BUGFIX] Correct var type for Date property
Resolves: #36520
[BUGFIX] Removes typos in locallang_mod.xlft
Resolves: #36552
[TASK] Changed error type to warning for wrong type field It should be possible to save an extension, even if the table that should be extended has a wrong typefield column data type. (Like the pages table)
[TASK] add hint about rewritten property mapper in generated TypoScript Setup
[TASK] Fix missing type hint in Class Building
[BUGFIX] Fix generated TCA for Single-Table Inheritance
we need to use require() instead of require_once() to include the subclass
TCA reliably. I just had the case that in some circumstances, the TCA
is loaded multiple times (for example when having multiple plugins
on the same page). For the first time, the TCA is complete, i.e. contains
both the parent and the sub-class fields. However, at the second load,
only the parent class is loaded because require_once skips the subclasses
as PHP had them already loaded.
That's a really hard-to-track-down issue which we should solve in the
Extension Builder.
[RELEASE] Uploaded Version 2.3 to TER
{TASK] Added locallang_db.xlf file
[TASK] Remove unused FlashMessage in Layout
[TASK] Fix broken function test
[BUGFIX] Lazy loading tag was not set
Resolves: #35040
[BUGFIX] Change storagePid constant type to string
Resolves: #35685
[TASK] It should be possible to add TYPO3 specific property names
Fields like crdate, sorting etc. should be possible as model properties.
This will result in a warning now, not in an error.
[BUGFIX] Column type check was not dbal compatible
Not sure if the result of "DESCRIBE" is the same on other database engines
Related to #34320
[BUGFIX] Wrong conditions generated warnings
If no actions were configured there was a warning even if no Plugin or Backend module was added
Merge "[BUGFIX] Parent class settings were not reflected"
[BUGFIX] Parent class settings were not reflected
Fix errors in Tx_ExtensionBuilder_Configuration_ConfigurationManager->getParentClassForEntityObject
[BUGFIX] RTE fields not rendered on backend
Relates #34919
[BUGFIX] Foud 2 more missing form temple partials
[BUGFIX] Delete action still had a true default value
[BUGFIX] Removed wrong slashes to avoid parser warning
[TASK] Add a check for the type fields type
The type field column may not be of type INT with single table inheritance
since the field can not be used to store the record type
Resolves: #34320
[BUGFIX] Change parent class if a domain objects type changes
Resolves: #34651
[BUGFIX] Remove method="post" argument from form viewhelper in generated templates
Resolves #34484
[TASK] !!!Boolean property defaults to FALSE now
To avoid error messages generated by the fluid form.checkbox view helper, boolean properties default value is FALSE now.
This might be a breaking change in case there is a distinction between
isset() and FALSE in conditions (which is no good code style anyway...)
Resolves: #34537
[TASK] Added missing property types templates
Also the not yet in extbase implemented property types are marked now
Resolves: #34687
[TASK] Enable target versions and xliff files
Create xliff files for target versions > 4.5
Merging of xlif files not yet supported!
Resolves #32027

[TASK] Added xlf files for language labels
The locallang.xml will remain for being compatible with TYPO3 v 4.5
[TASK] Refactored CodeGenerator
[TASK] Refactoring Controller, Introduced Repository
[BUGFIX] added condition to avoid calling non existent method
Resolves #34310
The method setUseExtendedRelationTableName may only be called on
Tx_ExtensionBuilder_Domain_Model_DomainObject_Relation_AnyToManyRelations
[TASK] Disable actions by default
If all actions are enabled by default, this might result in superflous action methods in the Controller and thus in a security risk, if the developer might not be aware of them
